Data was selected from [Bearing data center datasets](https://engineering.case.edu/bearingdatacenter/12k-drive-end-bearing-fault-data) and represenets 12KHz sampled 16-channel vibration accelerometer output for different EDM-damaged fault diameter (0.007, 0.014, 0.021 in) in a different places (ball, inner race, outer race) and different load factor on the rotor.
